## Deep Neural Networks for Many Body Quantum Systems

Deep neural networks for many body electronic wavefunctions.

Logic: 

* DNN are ultra successful "quantum chemistry" wavefunctions (NetKet . . . ).

* Then, if DNN so successful, might say that quantum wavefunction is in fact a DNN (not just an approximation function).

* If quantum systems are DNN, then has implications for reality: hidden variables, retrocausal (quote from Autodidactic)

* Broader views
	** DNN as quantum chemistry (NetKet, FermiNet, . . . )

	** DNN and Quantum Gravity (ADS/CFT, Hashimoto, Cao/Bao, . . . )

	** DNN as cosmic laws (Autodidactic, Sabine/Bobby, . . . )
